Following Advent of Vim from https://github.com/aovim

Due to all the other things going on in my life, this will not follow the standard _advent of_ format of daily challenge completions.
Instead, challenges will be completed whenever there is time or skipped if they seem time consuming rather than educational.

No scoreboards here.

Solutions are stored as macros.
Run them with `:let @x = join(readfile("PATH"), "\n")`
